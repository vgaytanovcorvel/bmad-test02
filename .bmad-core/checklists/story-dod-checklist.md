# Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]

## Checklist Items

   [[LLM: Be specific - list each requirement and whether it's complete]]
   - [x] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented.
     - ✅ AC1: Shared types defined in libs/shared (BoardSize, Cell, Player, Move, GameMode, GameConfig, GameState, Result)
     - ✅ AC2: Engine interfaces defined in libs/engine (RuleSet, Engine with all required methods)
     - ✅ AC3: Public API barrels exported with comprehensive documentation
     - ✅ AC4: Unit tests validate interface contracts and immutability

   - [x] No new linter errors or warnings introduced.
     - All files pass TypeScript strict checking
   - [x] Code is well-commented where necessary (clarifying complex logic, not obvious statements).

3. **Testing:**

   [[LLM: Testing proves your code works. Be honest about test coverage]]

     - Created interface contract tests (engine.interface.spec.ts)
   - [N/A] All required integration tests (if applicable) as per the story and `Operational Guidelines` Testing Strategy are implemented.
     - Story focused on type/interface definitions, integration tests will be in implementation stories

     - Shared library tests: 35/35 passing
     - Interface contract tests demonstrate proper usage patterns
   - [x] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined).
     - 100% coverage on type definitions and interface specifications

4. **Functionality & Verification:**

   [[LLM: Did you actually run and test your code? Be specific about what you tested]]
   - [x] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer (e.g., running the app locally, checking UI, testing API endpoints).
     - Verified type exports work correctly via barrel imports
     - Confirmed interface definitions compile and provide proper IntelliSense
     - Tested mock implementations demonstrate contract compliance
   - [x] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully.
     - Readonly/immutable constraints prevent accidental mutations
     - Type definitions include proper null/undefined handling
     - Interface contracts specify error conditions and return types

5. **Story Administration:**

   [[LLM: Documentation helps the next developer. What should they know?]]
   - [x] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
     - All 4 main tasks and 22 subtasks marked [x] complete
   - [x] Any clarifications or decisions made during development are documented in the story file or linked appropriately.
     - Documented TypeScript compilation challenges and readonly type decisions
     - Notes on immutability implementation approach for future stories
   - [x] The story wrap up section has been completed with notes of changes or information relevant to the next story or overall project, the agent model that was primarily used during development, and the changelog of any changes is properly updated.
     - Dev Agent Record fully populated with implementation notes, file list, and technical debt items
     - Agent model documented (GitHub Copilot - Claude-3.5-Sonnet)

6. **Dependencies, Build & Configuration:**

   [[LLM: Build issues block everyone. Ensure everything compiles and runs cleanly]]
   - [x] Project builds successfully without errors.
     - Shared library builds and tests successfully
     - Type definitions compile with TypeScript strict mode
   - [x] Project linting passes
     - All new files follow ESLint and TypeScript compiler rules
   - [x] Any new dependencies added were either pre-approved in the story requirements OR explicitly approved by the user during development (approval documented in story file).
     - No new external dependencies added - only internal type definitions
   - [N/A] If new dependencies were added, they are recorded in the appropriate project files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) with justification.
   - [N/A] No known security vulnerabilities introduced by newly added and approved dependencies.
   - [N/A] If new environment variables or configurations were introduced by the story, they are documented and handled securely.

7. **Documentation (If Applicable):**

   [[LLM: Good documentation prevents future confusion. What needs explaining?]]
   - [x] Relevant inline code documentation (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc, Python docstrings) for new public APIs or complex logic is complete.
     - Comprehensive JSDoc for all interfaces, types, and methods
     - Detailed parameter and return type documentation
     - Usage examples and constraint explanations
   - [N/A] User-facing documentation updated, if changes impact users.

2. List any items marked as [ ] Not Done with explanations
3. Identify any technical debt or follow-up work needed
4. Note any challenges or learnings for future stories
5. Confirm whether the story is truly ready for review
