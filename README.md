# Agentic AI Tic-Tac-Toe Showcase

A sophisticated tic-tac-toe implementation demonstrating Angular 17+, Nx monorepo architecture, Tailwind CSS, and intelligent AI game engine capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Project Structure

This project is built using a modern monorepo structure with Nx workspace:

```
tic-tac-toe-showcase/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                    # Angular 17+ application with Vite
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui-e2e/               # Playwright E2E tests

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engine/               # Game engine and AI logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/               # Shared types and utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                     # Project documentation
```

### Core Architecture Principles

**Separation of Concerns:**
- **UI Layer** (`apps/ui`): Pure presentation and user interaction
- **Engine Layer** (`libs/engine`): Game logic, rules, and AI decision-making
- **Shared Layer** (`libs/shared`): Common types, interfaces, and utilities
- **Testing Layer** (`apps/ui-e2e`): End-to-end behavioral validation

**Dependency Direction:**
- UI depends on Engine and Shared
- Engine depends only on Shared
- Shared has no dependencies
- Clear, unidirectional dependency flow prevents circular references

### Game Engine Design Rationale

The game engine represents the core intellectual property of this showcase, demonstrating enterprise-grade architectural patterns applied to game development.

#### Immutable State Management

**Design Decision**: All game state is immutable with pure function transformations.

```typescript
// Pure state transition - no mutations
function applyMove(currentState: GameState, move: Move): GameState {
  return {
    ...currentState,
    board: updateBoard(currentState.board, move),
    currentPlayer: getNextPlayer(currentState.currentPlayer),
    moveHistory: [...currentState.moveHistory, move]
  };
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **Predictable Debugging**: State snapshots enable time-travel debugging
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Pure functions are easily testable in isolation
- **Undo/Redo Support**: Complete move history enables game replay functionality
- **Concurrent Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe
- **Caching Optimization**: Unchanged state objects can be safely cached

#### Exhaustive Search Algorithm for Optimal AI

**Algorithm Choice**: Complete minimax search with position evaluation for 3x3 and 4x4 boards.

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **3x3 Board**: Maximum 9 positions, optimal move calculation <1ms
- **4x4 Board**: Maximum 16 positions with k=3 condition, optimal move <5ms
- **Algorithm Complexity**: O(n¬≤) for board scan, O(k) for line evaluation
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal due to position-based representation

**Why Exhaustive Search Works:**

*3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe (Traditional):*
- **Total Game States**: ~5,478 unique board positions
- **Decision Tree Depth**: Maximum 9 moves (alternating players)
- **Computational Load**: Modern processors handle complete search <10ms
- **Perfect Play**: AI can guarantee optimal outcome (win or draw)

*4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe (K=3):*
- **Total Positions**: 16 cells = 2^16 possible states, but game ends early
- **Winning Condition**: 3-in-a-row is achievable, preventing excessive game length
- **Search Pruning**: Games typically end within 6-10 moves due to multiple winning lines
- **Practical Performance**: Real-world optimal moves calculated <5ms

**Algorithm Implementation:**
```typescript
// K-in-row detection with configurable parameters
function findWinningLines(board: Board, k: number): WinningLine[] {
  const lines: WinningLine[] = [];
  const size = Math.sqrt(board.length);
  
  // Scan all directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, anti-diagonal
  for (let row = 0; row < size; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < size; col++) {
      [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [1,-1]].forEach(([deltaRow, deltaCol]) => {
        const line = extractLine(board, row, col, deltaRow, deltaCol, k);
        if (isWinningLine(line)) lines.push(line);
      });
    }
  }
  return lines;
}
```

#### Factory Pattern for Engine Configuration

**Design Pattern**: Factory methods provide pre-configured engines for different game modes.

```typescript
// Centralized configuration prevents misconfiguration
export class EngineFactory {
  static create3x3Engine(): GameEngine {
    return new GameEngine({ boardSize: 3, winCondition: 3 });
  }
  
  static create4x4Engine(): GameEngine {
    return new GameEngine({ boardSize: 4, winCondition: 3 });
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: Prevents invalid board size + k-value combinations
- **Extensibility**: New game modes added through factory methods
- **Documentation**: Factory methods serve as usage examples
- **Testing**: Known-good configurations simplify test setup

#### Position-Based Board Representation

**Representation**: Linear array with mathematical coordinate conversion.

```typescript
// 3x3 positions:     4x4 positions:
// 0 | 1 | 2          0  | 1  | 2  | 3
// --|---|--          ---|----|----|---
// 3 | 4 | 5          4  | 5  | 6  | 7
// --|---|--          ---|----|----|---
// 6 | 7 | 8          8  | 9  | 10 | 11
//                    ---|----|----|---
//                    12 | 13 | 14 | 15

// Conversion functions
function positionToCoordinates(position: number, boardSize: number): [number, number] {
  return [Math.floor(position / boardSize), position % boardSize];
}

function coordinatesToPosition(row: number, col: number, boardSize: number): number {
  return row * boardSize + col;
}
```

**Advantages:**
- **Efficient Storage**: Single array instead of nested data structures
- **Fast Access**: Direct indexing without nested loops
- **Universal Scanning**: Same algorithm works for any board size
- **Memory Optimization**: Minimal memory footprint for game state

### Future Extensibility Architecture

**Designed for Growth**: Current architecture supports planned extensions without breaking changes.

**Board Size Scaling:**
- **Algorithm Support**: K-in-row scales to any board size (5x5, 6x6, etc.)
- **Performance Path**: For large boards (8x8+), algorithm switches to alpha-beta pruning
- **Memory Management**: Position-based representation scales linearly
- **UI Adaptation**: Component architecture supports dynamic board rendering

**AI Strategy Extensions:**
- **Difficulty Levels**: Current perfect play can be reduced for casual play
- **Machine Learning**: Pure function architecture enables training data collection
- **Multi-Agent**: Immutable state supports multiple AI opponents
- **Opening Books**: Pre-computed optimal opening moves for enhanced performance

**Game Type Extensions:**
- **Connect Four**: Same k-in-row algorithm with gravity constraints
- **Gomoku**: Larger boards (15x15) with k=5 winning condition
- **Multi-Player**: State management supports >2 players
- **Network Play**: Immutable state serializes perfectly for network sync

### Performance Optimizations

**Current Optimizations:**
- **Early Termination**: Move validation stops on first invalid condition
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Win detection only runs after moves, not continuously
- **Efficient Lookups**: Mathematical coordinate conversion vs. lookup tables
- **Minimal Allocations**: Board arrays reused where possible

**Benchmarked Performance:**
- **3x3 Optimal Move**: <1ms on modern hardware
- **4x4 Optimal Move**: <5ms on modern hardware
- **Memory Usage**: <1KB per game state
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Game engine adds <50KB to application bundle

#### Accessibility Implementation Details

**Semantic HTML Structure:**
```html
<!-- Game board with proper semantics -->
<main role="main" aria-label="Tic Tac Toe Game">
  <div role="grid" aria-label="Game board">
    <button role="gridcell" 
            aria-label="Row 1, Column 1, Empty" 
            aria-pressed="false">
      <!-- Cell content -->
    </button>
  </div>
</main>
```

**Screen Reader Game State Communication:**
- **Current Player**: "Player X's turn" or "Player O's turn"

- **Game Results**: "Player X wins with three in a row" or "Game ended in draw"
- **Controls**: "New Game button", "Mode selector: Human vs Computer"

**Keyboard Navigation Patterns:**
1. **Page Load**: Focus starts on game mode selector
2. **Game Board**: Arrow keys navigate cells, Tab moves to controls
3. **Cell Selection**: Space/Enter places move in focused cell
4. **Game End**: Focus moves to "New Game" button
5. **Persistent Focus**: Focus position maintained through game state changes

**Reduced Motion CSS Implementation:**
```css
/* Respect user motion preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}

/* Optional animation enhancement */
.game-cell {
  transition: transform 0.15s ease-in-out;
}

.game-cell:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
}

/* Disable hover effects for reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {

2. **Select Board Size**: Pick your preferred board dimensions (default is classic 3x3)
3. **Start Playing**: Click any cell to place the first move (typically X goes first)

**Human vs Human Mode:**
- Player 1 places X markers, Player 2 places O markers
- Players alternate turns by clicking empty cells
- Game continues until someone gets three in a row or board fills (draw)
- Use "New Game" to reset and play again with same mode

**Human vs Computer Mode:**
- You play as X, computer plays as O (or vice versa based on settings)
- Make your move by clicking an empty cell
- Computer automatically makes its move after yours
- AI will try to win and block your winning moves
- Challenge yourself against the intelligent computer opponent

**Winning the Game:**
- **Objective**: Get three of your markers (X or O) in a row
- **Winning Lines**: Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines count as wins
- **Win Highlighting**: Winning line gets highlighted when game ends
- **Game End**: No more moves possible after someone wins

**Draw Games:**
- **Full Board**: If all 9 cells fill with no winner, game ends in draw
- **Draw Detection**: Automatic detection when no more winning moves possible
- **Draw Display**: Clear messaging that game ended in tie
- **Reset Option**: Start new game to play again

### Optional Visual Enhancements

.game-cell:hover {
  /* transform: scale(1.02); */
  /* transition: transform 0.15s ease-in-out; */
}

/* To enhance move placement effects: */
.game-cell.new-move {
  /* animation: placeMove 0.2s ease-out; */
}
```

- [ ] **Local Preview**: `npm run preview` serves correctly at localhost:4200
- [ ] **Health Endpoint**: `/health` displays app info and green status
- [ ] **SPA Routing**: Direct navigation to `/health` and `/credits` works (no 404)
- [ ] **Build Assets**: `dist/apps/ui/browser/` contains optimized files
- [ ] **Build Hash**: Unique hash appears in health check page
- [ ] **Environment**: Shows "Production" in health check when built
- [ ] **No Console Errors**: Browser dev tools show clean console

**Post-Deployment Verification:**
- [ ] **Deployed URL Access**: Site loads at provided deployment URL
- [ ] **All Routes Functional**: Test `/`, `/health`, `/credits` via direct navigation
- [ ] **Game Functionality**: Tic-tac-toe game works correctly
- [ ] **Health Status**: Green status indicator shows on `/health`
- [ ] **Build Hash Unique**: Health page shows deployment-specific build hash

curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health

# Should return 200 status code and HTML containing:
# - "Healthy" status indicator
# - Application name: "Tic Tac Toe Showcase"
# - Version: current version number
# - Build hash: deployment-specific hash
# - Environment: "Production"
```

#### Deployment Troubleshooting

**Build and Pre-Deployment Issues:**

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Clear all caches and rebuild
pnpm nx reset
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf .angular/cache
npm run build:ui:static

# Check for memory issues
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
npm run build:ui:static

# Verify build dependencies
pnpm install
npm run validate  # Run full validation pipeline
```

**Local Preview Issues:**
```bash
# Build not serving locally
npm run build:ui:static
cd dist/apps/ui/browser
python -m http.server 4200  # Python alternative
# or
npx serve -s . -l 4200      # Node.js alternative
```

**Deployment Platform Issues:**

**SPA Routing Issues (404 on refresh):**
- **Vercel**: Verify `vercel.json` contains `{"src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html"}`
- **Netlify**: Verify `netlify.toml` contains `[[redirects]]` with fallback to `/index.html`
- **General**: Ensure hosting platform supports SPA routing configuration
- **Manual Fix**: Add `_redirects` file containing `/*    /index.html   200`

**Build Command Issues:**
```bash
# If platform doesn't recognize npm commands
# Use direct Node.js command instead:
node_modules/.bin/nx build ui --configuration=static

# Or specify full path to build:
./node_modules/.bin/pnpm run build:ui:static
```

**Environment Variable Issues:**
- **Missing BUILD_HASH**: Verify `tools/build-hash.js` runs during build
- **Wrong Environment**: Check environment shows "Production" on deployed health page
- **Version Mismatch**: Verify `package.json` version matches health page display

**Asset Loading Issues:**
- **Missing Static Files**: Check `dist/apps/ui/browser/assets/` contains required files
- **CORS Issues**: Verify hosting platform serves all file types correctly
- **Cache Issues**: Clear browser cache or test in incognito mode

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:ui:static
ls -lh dist/apps/ui/browser/*.js
# Main bundle should be < 500KB gzipped

# Check for large dependencies
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/apps/ui/browser
```

**Domain and HTTPS Issues:**
- **Mixed Content**: Verify all resources load over HTTPS in production
- **Custom Domain**: Check DNS configuration and SSL certificate status  
- **Redirect Loops**: Verify hosting platform HTTPS redirect settings

**Debug Deployment Issues:**
```bash
# Check deployment logs (platform-specific)
vercel logs <deployment-url>    # Vercel
netlify logs                    # Netlify

# Test production build locally
npm run build:ui:static
npm run preview
# Compare local preview with deployed version
```

#### Rollback and Recovery

**Quick Rollback (Vercel):**
```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Promote previous deployment to production
vercel promote <deployment-url> --prod
```

**Quick Rollback (Netlify):**
```bash
# View deployment history
netlify sites:list

# Restore previous deployment via dashboard
# Or redeploy from previous Git commit
```

**Emergency Recovery:**
1. **Revert Git Changes**: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. **Rebuild and Deploy**: `npm run build:ui:static` then redeploy
3. **Monitor Health**: Check `/health` endpoint shows green status
4. **Verify Functionality**: Test core game features work correctly

#### Performance and Monitoring

**Build Optimization:**
- Bundle size optimized with tree-shaking
- Asset compression enabled by hosting platforms
- CDN distribution automatic on Vercel/Netlify

**Health Check Monitoring:**
- Health endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/health`
- Monitor build hash to verify deployments
- Status indicator shows green for healthy application

**Security Headers:**
- Configured in `netlify.toml` for enhanced security
- Content Security Policy ready for implementation
- HTTPS enforced by hosting platforms

#### Custom Domain Configuration

**Vercel:**
```bash
# Add custom domain via CLI
vercel domains add your-domain.com

# Or configure via Vercel dashboard
```

**Netlify:**
```bash
# Add custom domain via CLI
netlify sites:create --name your-site-name
netlify domains:create your-domain.com
```

#### Continuous Deployment

Both platforms support automatic deployment from Git repositories:

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your Git repository to hosting platform
2. **Build Settings**: 
   - Build command: `npm run build:ui:prod`
   - Publish directory: `dist/apps/ui/browser`
3. **Environment Variables**: Set `NODE_VERSION=18` if needed
4. **Deploy Branches**: Configure which branches trigger deployments
