## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-09-25

## Context

The Tic Tac Toe Showcase project requires a modern, maintainable frontend technology stack that enables:
- Rapid development and prototyping
- High-quality user experience with smooth interactions
- Comprehensive testing capabilities (unit, integration, E2E)
- Professional-grade code quality and maintainability
- Efficient development tooling and build processes
- Future extensibility for additional game features

The project serves as a showcase for agentic AI capabilities and must demonstrate best practices in modern web development.

## Decision

We have selected the following technology stack:

### Core Framework
- **Angular 17+**: Primary SPA framework
- **TypeScript 5.x**: Type-safe development with strict mode

### Build and Development Tools
- **Nx**: Monorepo tooling and project orchestration
- **Vite**: Modern build tool with fast HMR
- **PNPM**: Efficient package manager with workspace support

### UI and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS 3.x**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Angular Signals**: Built-in reactive state management

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **@testing-library/angular**: Component integration testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing across browsers

### Code Quality
- **ESLint**: Linting with Angular-specific rules
- **Prettier**: Automated code formatting

## Rationale

### Angular 17+ Selection
- **Modern Architecture**: Standalone components eliminate NgModule complexity
- **Angular Signals**: Built-in reactivity ideal for simple game state management
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Comprehensive tooling and community support
- **TypeScript Integration**: Excellent type safety and developer experience
- **Performance**: OnPush change detection and optimized rendering
- **Future-Ready**: Latest features and long-term Angular roadmap alignment

### Nx Monorepo Tooling
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between game engine, UI, and shared utilities
- **Code Sharing**: Efficient reuse of types and utilities across apps/libs
- **Integrated Testing**: Unified testing strategy across all packages
- **Build Optimization**: Intelligent caching and dependency graph management
- **Scalability**: Foundation for future expansion (multiplayer, AI variations)

### Vite Build System
- **Fast Development**: Sub-second hot module replacement
- **Modern Bundling**: Optimized for Angular 17+ and ESM
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich plugin support for additional tooling
- **Production Optimization**: Efficient code splitting and minification

### PNPM Package Management
- **Disk Efficiency**: Shared dependencies reduce storage requirements
- **Fast Installs**: Parallel downloads and intelligent caching
- **Workspace Support**: Native monorepo dependency management
- **Strict Dependencies**: Prevents phantom dependency issues

### Tailwind CSS Styling
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Utility classes enable quick UI iteration
- **Consistent Design**: Built-in design system prevents style drift
- **Small Bundle Size**: Purged CSS results in minimal production footprint
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint utilities
- **Customization**: Easy theming and component styling

### Angular Signals State Management
- **Lightweight**: No external state management library required
- **Built-in Reactivity**: Native Angular integration
- **Simple State**: Perfect for tic-tac-toe game state complexity
- **Performance**: Optimized change detection and rendering
- **Developer Experience**: Familiar Angular patterns and debugging

### Testing Stack Rationale
- **Jest**: Fast test execution with excellent Angular integration
- **Testing Library**: User-centric testing approach promotes maintainable tests
- **Playwright**: Reliable cross-browser E2E testing with modern capabilities
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Three testing layers ensure quality at all levels

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modern Development Experience**: Latest Angular features and tooling
- **High Performance**: Optimized build and runtime performance
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full testing pyramid with quality gates
- **Future Extensibility**: Foundation supports additional features and games
- **Developer Productivity**: Efficient tooling and hot reload capabilities
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need familiarity with Angular 17+ patterns
- **Build Complexity**: Nx and Vite configuration requires setup and maintenance
- **Dependency Management**: Multiple tools require coordination and updates
- **Bundle Size**: Angular framework overhead for simple tic-tac-toe functionality

### Mitigations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architecture and developer guidelines
- **Standards**: Established coding patterns and component templates
- **Automation**: Quality gates and CI/CD pipelines enforce best practices
- **Monitoring**: Bundle size tracking and performance optimization
