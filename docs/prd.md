# Agentic AI Tic Tac Toe Showcase Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Demonstrate Agentic AI's capability to create production-quality, well-architected applications following established engineering best practices.
- Showcase BMAD methodology effectiveness in producing maintainable, high-quality software with clean architecture patterns.
- Increase confidence in AI-assisted development among professional software engineers.
- Provide concrete evidence that AI can follow sophisticated development methodologies like TDD.
- Create a comprehensive reference implementation for professional software development teams.
- Deliver modular architecture with >90% test coverage and comprehensive documentation.
- Enable engineers to easily understand, extend, and learn from the AI-generated codebase.

### Background Context
Software engineers currently lack concrete examples of how Agentic AI can create enterprise-grade applications that follow established engineering best practices. Most AI-generated code demonstrations are either simplistic showcases or monolithic implementations that fail to demonstrate proper software architecture patterns, comprehensive testing strategies, or adherence to methodologies like TDD. This knowledge gap significantly slows the adoption of AI-assisted development tools in professional software engineering teams.

The Agentic AI Tic Tac Toe Showcase addresses this critical need by using a familiar problem domain to focus attention on sophisticated engineering practices rather than domain complexity. By demonstrating AI's ability to create modular, well-tested, and maintainable code, this project serves as a bridge between AI skepticism and adoption confidence in professional development environments.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- FR1: Establish project scaffolding and CI/CD with a minimal health-check route or canary page to enable continuous testing and deployment from Day 1.
- FR2: Implement a game engine supporting two board sizes and win rules: 3x3 (k=3) and 6x6 (k=4). Winning lines include any contiguous k-in-a-row across rows, columns, and both diagonals. Include legal move validation, turn alternation, terminal-state detection (win/draw), and reject invalid moves (occupied cell or post-terminal) with a clear error. Mode is selected at game start and surfaced for tests/UI.
- FR3: Provide state management with undo/redo: maintain a per-move history stack; invalidate redo when a new move occurs after an undo; no hard limit for MVP (configurable limit exposed for tests).
- FR4: Support gameplay modes: human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI, selectable before game start and switchable between rounds.
- FR5: Implement AI difficulties with deterministic behavior definitions:
  - Easy: With 50% probability choose uniformly at random from legal moves; otherwise use the strategic engine.
  - Medium: With 25% probability choose uniformly at random from legal moves; otherwise use the strategic engine.
  - Hard: Compute and play the game-theoretic optimal move (perfect play) for both modes; implement full search with alpha-beta pruning and a transposition table where needed to meet performance targets. Randomness uses a seeded PRNG with seed surfaced for reproducible tests. Strategic tie-breakers: quickest win, then minimize opponent’s best outcome, then center/corners preference, then lowest index.
- FR6: Deliver a responsive web UI that renders the board, indicates current player, allows move input, shows outcomes (win/draw), and supports starting a new game. Use animated, 3D marks for player symbols with entry animations ≤300ms and a reduced-motion fallback.
- FR7: Implement a 3D-styled board in a top-down classic layout. Provide a visible "lock" treatment indicating active vs terminal board states; upon game over, overlay a brief lock animation that disables further input without harming readability.
- FR8: Expose internal module interfaces between UI, engine, players, and state management to demonstrate clear separation of concerns.
- FR9: Provide a comprehensive automated test suite developed via TDD, including unit tests (k-in-row on both sizes, AI difficulty selection including randomness ratios via seeded runs, undo/redo semantics), integration tests (UI ↔ engine ↔ AI), and e2e tests (H vs AI and AI vs AI) across both board sizes and difficulty levels.
 - FR9: Provide a comprehensive automated test suite developed via TDD, including unit tests (k-in-row on both sizes, AI difficulty selection including randomness ratios via seeded runs, undo/redo semantics), integration tests (UI ↔ engine ↔ AI), and e2e tests (H vs AI and AI vs AI) across both board sizes and difficulty levels.
 - FR10: Provide a Credits/About page accessible from the main UI (settings/start and footer link) that lists contributors, acknowledges third-party libraries/frameworks (Angular, Nx, Tailwind, Babylon.js, NgRx, Playwright, seedrandom, etc.) with versions and licenses, and links to the project repository and LICENSE/NOTICE files.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR1: Achieve and maintain >90% automated test coverage across all modules.
- NFR2: Enforce clear modular boundaries and separation of concerns with documented interfaces and module contracts.
- NFR3: Meet performance targets: <100ms response time for game operations; initial load bundle size <2MB; animations target 60fps; hard-level AI decision latency <100ms p50 and <500ms p95 for mid-game positions on typical hardware, with graceful UI feedback if exceeded.
- NFR4: Provide complete documentation: README, API docs, architecture decisions (ADRs), and a development guide describing TDD workflow.
- NFR5: Implement secure coding practices including strict input validation and XSS protection for any user-input surfaces.
- NFR6: Ensure cross-browser support for modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).
- NFR7: Maintain code quality via linting, formatting, and pre-commit CI checks; all PRs must pass tests and linters before merge.
- NFR8: Ensure maintainability by keeping functions small, modules cohesive, and public APIs stable with semantic versioning inside the repo.
- NFR9: Provide accessibility fundamentals (semantic HTML, sufficient contrast) and honor prefers-reduced-motion; ensure 3D visuals maintain readability and announce state changes (e.g., wins) via ARIA live regions.
- NFR10: Provide developer ergonomics: fast local test runs, deterministic tests, and clear scripts to run, test, and build; expose PRNG seeding for reproducible test scenarios.
- NFR11: UI asset efficiency: Tailwind CSS for styling; prefer vector assets; additional 3D/animation assets budget ≤300KB gzip. If using Babylon.js, lazy-load it as a separate chunk ≤800KB gzip and keep the initial route bundle <2MB.
 - NFR12: Licensing & attribution compliance: Credits page must surface license names and links for third-party dependencies; repository includes LICENSE and NOTICE; an automated script generates a `credits.json` from package manifests to keep attributions accurate.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
- Professional, minimalist, and educational showcase that highlights engineering quality without visual clutter.
- Top-down classic board layout enhanced with subtle 3D styling (depth, shadows) and animated 3D X/O marks.
- Motion used sparingly to communicate state changes (mark placement, win highlight, board lock) with a reduced-motion fallback.
- Clear information hierarchy: current player, game state, controls (new game, undo/redo), mode indicators (board size, difficulty).
- Responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop with touch and pointer support.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Single primary play view with lightweight overlays for settings and results.
- Input: click/tap to place mark; on-screen controls to close overlays.
- Controls: pre-game selector for board size (3x3, 6x6) and difficulty; in-game undo/redo; restart; switch mode between rounds.
- Feedback: animated mark placement (≤300ms), winning line highlight, and a brief lock animation on terminal state that disables input.
 - Feedback: animated mark placement (≤300ms), winning line highlight, and a brief lock animation on terminal state that disables input; 3D effects rendered via a WebGL canvas overlay when enabled.
- Accessibility: ARIA live announcements for turn changes and results, respects prefers-reduced-motion, and maintains sufficient contrast.

### Core Screens and Views
- Start/Settings Modal: choose board size and difficulty; brief explanations of AI levels.
- Game Board View: board grid, current player indicator, controls (undo/redo/restart), minimal status bar with mode indicators.
- Result/Replay Overlay: win/draw message, winning-line highlight, options to replay or change settings.
- Learn/Docs Panel (optional): link to documentation about architecture, TDD, and BMAD highlights.
 - Credits/About Page: contributors, third-party acknowledgments with versions/licenses, links to repo and legal files.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
- Sufficient contrast; color choices pass AA contrast for text and UI components.
- Reduced-motion alternative for all animations; no critical information conveyed by motion alone.
- ARIA live region announcements for game start, turn changes, invalid moves, wins/draws, and board lock.

### Branding
- Neutral, modern styling aligned to a technical audience; no proprietary brand constraints identified.
- 3D aesthetic implemented with CSS transforms and lighting cues; avoid heavy textures to meet asset budget.
 - 3D aesthetic implemented with Babylon.js (WebGL) for marks and board lock; provide CSS transforms fallback when reduced-motion is enabled or WebGL is unavailable; avoid heavy textures to meet asset budget.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- Modern desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with touch and pointer input support.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo (Nx)
- Use Nx with PNPM workspaces to enforce modular boundaries and caching.
- Apps/Libs:
  - `apps/ui` (Angular app)
  - `libs/engine` (pure TS game rules and k-in-row logic)
  - `libs/ai` (search, minimax/alpha-beta, transposition table)
  - `libs/shared` (types, utilities)
  - `apps/e2e` (Playwright tests)
- Rationale: Clear separation of concerns, fast CI via Nx cache, showcases modular architecture.

### Service Architecture
- Modular monolith centered on a client-side Angular SPA.
- No backend required for MVP; optional serverless endpoints post-MVP.
- Offload heavy AI computations to Web Workers to keep UI responsive.
- Rationale: Minimizes infra while demonstrating clean module APIs and strong testability.

### Testing Requirements
- Full testing pyramid with coverage ≥90%:
  - Unit: Jest for engine/ai/state services.
  - Component/Integration: @testing-library/angular for Angular components + service wiring.
  - E2E: Playwright (both board sizes, all AI levels, seeded runs for randomness ratios).
- CI gate: all tests + lint/format must pass before merge; coverage report uploaded.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Framework: Angular (no React). Use Nx Angular with Vite bundler.
- Builder: Vite-based build/dev server (Nx Angular Vite or Angular's Vite builder); optimize with esbuild/rollup.
 - Styling: Tailwind CSS (Angular integration) with utility-first classes, design tokens, and a minimal custom theme.
 - 3D Rendering: Babylon.js for animated 3D marks and board lock; load lazily via dynamic import to keep initial bundle small; render in a separate WebGL canvas layered under UI; provide CSS-based 3D fallback.
 - Credits Data & Routing: Add a build-time script to emit `credits.json` (dependency name, version, license, homepage). Angular route `/credits` renders the Credits/About page by consuming this JSON and static content (contributors, repo links).
- Language: TypeScript strict mode across all libs/apps.
- State Management: NgRx store for game and settings; implement undo/redo via a history service integrated with store.
- AI Engine: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning + transposition table (Zobrist hashing), iterative deepening; perfect play for both 3x3(k=3) and 6x6(k=4).
- Web Workers: Generate workers for AI computations (`ng generate web-worker`); message-based API between UI and AI.
- PRNG: `seedrandom` for seeded difficulty behavior; seed surfaced via UI and URL param for reproducibility.
- Performance: Enforce hard-level decision latency targets; show spinner if exceeded and keep under 500ms p95.
 - Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Husky + lint-staged, commitlint; Tailwind + PostCSS config; ADRs under `docs/architecture/`.
- Hosting: Static deploy (Vercel/Netlify) with SPA fallback; environment config via Angular environments.
- Security: Sanitize user-visible strings; strict DOM APIs; avoid eval; recommend CSP in deployment guide.
