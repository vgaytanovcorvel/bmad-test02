# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Demonstrate Agentic AI's capability to create production-quality, well-architected applications following established engineering best practices.
- Showcase BMAD methodology effectiveness in producing maintainable, high-quality software with clean architecture patterns.
- Increase confidence in AI-assisted development among professional software engineers.
- Provide concrete evidence that AI can follow sophisticated development methodologies like TDD.
- Create a comprehensive reference implementation for professional software development teams.
- Deliver modular architecture with >90% test coverage and comprehensive documentation.
- Enable engineers to easily understand, extend, and learn from the AI-generated codebase.

### Background Context
Software engineers currently lack concrete examples of how Agentic AI can create enterprise-grade applications that follow established engineering best practices. Most AI-generated code demonstrations are either simplistic showcases or monolithic implementations that fail to demonstrate proper software architecture patterns, comprehensive testing strategies, or adherence to methodologies like TDD. This knowledge gap significantly slows the adoption of AI-assisted development tools in professional software engineering teams.

The Agentic AI Tic Tac Toe Showcase addresses this critical need by using a familiar problem domain to focus attention on sophisticated engineering practices rather than domain complexity. By demonstrating AI's ability to create modular, well-tested, and maintainable code, this project serves as a bridge between AI skepticism and adoption confidence in professional development environments.

### Change Log
| Date       | Version | Description                              | Author          |
|------------|---------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2025-09-21 | 1.0     | Initial PRD creation from project brief  | John (PM Agent) |
| 2025-09-24 | 1.1     | Simplified scope: single perfect computer opponent (exhaustive search), removed difficulty tiers, undo/redo history, AI vs AI mode, multi-layer diagnostics & e2e harness; diagnostics limited to unit tests | John (PM Agent) |
| 2025-09-24 | 1.2     | Reintroduced integration & e2e test layers (smoke + basic gameplay flows) while keeping simplified architecture | John (PM Agent) |
| 2025-09-25 | 1.3     | Further scope reduction: board sizes limited to 3x3 & 4x4 (k=3 only); removed 7x7 (k=4); dropped memoization, accessibility (ARIA/reduced-motion) requirements, cross-browser matrix (Chrome & Edge only now), and bundle size budget. Updated tests & epics accordingly; added future extensibility notes. | PO |
