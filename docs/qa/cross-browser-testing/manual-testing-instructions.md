   - Test at 100% zoom level (baseline)
   - Test at 150% zoom level
   - Test at 200% zoom level
   - Verify text remains readable and interactive elements accessible

### Phase 2: Mobile Viewport Testing

#### Step 1: Mobile Viewport Setup
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Enable device simulation/responsive design mode
3. Set viewport to 375px width (iPhone standard)
4. Set user agent to mobile device (if option available)

   - Test all functionality in landscape mode
   - Check horizontal scrolling is not required

### Phase 3: Performance and Load Testing
