# Story 1.1: Scaffold Monorepo and Baseline Tooling

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** a fully configured Nx monorepo workspace with Angular, Vite, Tailwind, and quality tooling,
**so that** we can begin TDD development with a solid foundation, proper project structure, and automated quality checks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Nx workspace created with PNPM; layout initialized: `apps/ui`, `libs/engine`, `libs/shared`, `apps/ui-e2e` (Playwright project).
2. Angular app configured to use Vite builder; TypeScript strict mode enabled globally.
3. Tailwind CSS integrated with PostCSS; base theme utilities available in the UI app.
4. ESLint + Prettier configured; formatter and linter scripts available to run locally.
5. README updated with setup, run, and test commands.

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Standards
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]

The workspace must follow the defined project structure:
```
tic-tac-toe-showcase/
├── apps/
│   ├── ui/                          # Main Angular application
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── app/
│   │   │   │   ├── components/      # Standalone Angular components
│   │   │   │   ├── pages/           # Route components  
│   │   │   │   ├── services/        # Angular services
│   │   │   │   ├── app.routes.ts    # Route configuration
│   │   │   │   ├── app.config.ts    # App configuration

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

Required technology versions and purposes:
- **Framework**: Angular 17+ (SPA Framework with standalone components, signals)
- **Build System**: Nx Latest (Monorepo tooling for modular architecture)
- **Builder**: Vite Latest (Fast HMR, modern bundling, optimal for Angular 17+)
- **Package Manager**: PNPM Latest (Efficient disk usage, workspace support)
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.x (Utility-first CSS, consistent design system)
- **State Management**: Angular Signals 17+ (Lightweight, built-in, reactive state)
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript 5.x (Strict mode, enhanced developer experience)
- **Linting**: ESLint Latest (Angular-specific rules, TypeScript support)
- **Formatting**: Prettier Latest (Consistent style, automated formatting)

### Development Standards to Implement
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

Critical coding rules that must be configured:
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Always use strict TypeScript configuration
2. **Standalone Components**: Use Angular 17+ standalone component pattern
3. **Modern Template Syntax**: Use `@if`, `@for` instead of structural directives
4. **Code Style**: Follow Angular style guide and enforce with ESLint/Prettier
5. **Environment Config**: Use environment files for all configuration

### Component Architecture Foundation
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/component-architecture-standards.md]

Components must follow these patterns:
- Standalone Components using Angular 17+ pattern
- OnPush Change Detection for performance optimization
- Signal-Based Reactivity using computed signals
- Dependency Injection using `inject()` function over constructor injection
- Testing Attributes: Include `data-testid` for reliable test selectors

### Testing Framework Configuration
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

Testing setup requirements:
- **Unit Testing**: Jest (Fast, comprehensive, excellent Angular integration)
- **Integration Testing**: @testing-library/angular (User-centric testing approach)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (Reliable, fast, multi-browser support)
- **Coverage Goals**: Aim for 85% code coverage (unit + integration)
- Test file naming: `*.spec.ts` for unit tests, `*.e2e-spec.ts` for E2E tests

### File and Naming Conventions
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

File naming patterns to implement:
- Components: `game-board.component.ts`
- Services: `game.service.ts`
- Types: `game.types.ts`
- Tests: `*.spec.ts`
- E2E Tests: `*.e2e-spec.ts`

### Essential Package Scripts
Based on development workflow requirements:
- `pnpm nx serve ui` - Start development server
- `pnpm nx build ui` - Build for production  
- `pnpm nx test ui` - Run unit tests
- `pnpm nx e2e ui-e2e` - Run E2E tests
- `pnpm nx lint ui` - Lint code
- `pnpm nx graph` - View dependency graph

### Testing
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

Test file locations and standards:
- **Unit Tests**: Collocated with source files using `.spec.ts` extension
- **Integration Tests**: Same pattern, testing component interactions with services
- **E2E Tests**: Located in `apps/ui-e2e` using Playwright framework
- **Testing Framework**: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- **Test Structure**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- **Coverage**: 85% threshold for unit + integration tests
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies, test components in isolation

Testing configuration files needed:
- Jest configuration in each project's `project.json`
- Playwright configuration in `apps/ui-e2e/playwright.config.ts`
- TestBed setup for Angular component testing
- Mock factory functions for consistent test data
