# Story 1.4: Testing Baseline (Unit, Integration, E2E Harness)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** comprehensive testing baseline with clear separation between unit, integration, and E2E tests across all workspace projects,
**so that** we can ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain confidence in our application through automated testing at all levels.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Jest configured for unit & integration tests (separate folder conventions or naming patterns) in `libs/engine`, `libs/shared`, and `apps/ui`.
2. @testing-library/angular sample integration test exercising move placement & computer response.
3. Playwright configured in `apps/ui-e2e` with basic `/health` smoke test.
4. Scripts differentiate unit vs integration vs e2e; CONTRIBUTING notes execution order.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Configure Jest for Unit & Integration Test Separation** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update Jest configuration files to distinguish unit vs integration test patterns
  - [x] Set up separate naming conventions: `*.spec.ts` for unit, `*.integration.spec.ts` for integration
  - [x] Configure test execution scripts to run unit and integration tests separately
  - [x] Verify coverage thresholds apply to combined unit+integration results
  - [x] Create sample unit tests for each workspace project (`libs/engine`, `libs/shared`, `apps/ui`)

  - [x] Include debugging and troubleshooting guides for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 successfully established foundational testing infrastructure with Jest, @testing-library/angular, and Playwright all operational. Coverage thresholds of ≥85% are enforced and working. Health check E2E test is functional and provides a baseline for expanded E2E testing.

Testing files should follow the established project structure patterns:

```

### Testing Framework Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Jest Configuration Updates Required:**
- Test file patterns must distinguish unit (`*.spec.ts`) vs integration (`*.integration.spec.ts`)
- Both patterns should be included in coverage calculations
- Separate test execution commands needed for targeted testing
- Coverage thresholds (≥85%) apply to combined unit+integration results

**@testing-library/angular Integration Testing Setup:**
```typescript
// Example integration test structure
describe('Game Integration', () => {
  it('should complete move placement with computer response', async () => {
    await render(GameComponent);
    
    // Human move placement
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('cell-0'));
    expect(screen.getByTestId('cell-0')).toHaveText('X');
    
    // Verify computer response
    await waitFor(() => {
      const occupiedCells = screen.getAllByText(/[XO]/);
      expect(occupiedCells).toHaveLength(2);
    });
  });
});
```

### Testing Standards and Patterns
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Unit Test Standards:**
- Test individual components and services in isolation
- Mock all external dependencies
- Use jasmine spies for Angular service testing
- Include `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

**Integration Test Standards:**
- Test component-service interactions
- Test complete user workflows
- Use @testing-library/angular for user-centric testing approach
- Include realistic game scenarios and state transitions
- Test error handling and edge cases

**E2E Test Standards:**
- Test critical user journeys end-to-end
- Include cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Use Playwright test utilities for reliable element interaction
- Include visual regression testing where appropriate

### Game Engine Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/project-structure.md]

**Engine Library Testing (`libs/engine`):**
- Unit tests for game logic, move validation, win detection
- Integration tests for complete game scenarios
- Computer player algorithm testing with deterministic outcomes
- Performance testing for algorithm efficiency
- Edge case testing (invalid moves, board states)

**Shared Library Testing (`libs/shared`):**
- Unit tests for utility functions and types
- Validation function testing
- Data structure and transformation testing
- Integration tests for cross-library dependencies

### Angular Component Testing Patterns
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/component-architecture-standards.md]

**Component Unit Testing Template:**
```typescript
describe('GameBoardComponent', () => {
  let component: GameBoardComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<GameBoardComponent>;
  let mockGameService: jasmine.SpyObj<GameService>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const gameServiceSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('GameService', ['makeMove'], {
      gameState: signal(mockGameState),
      isTerminal: signal(false)
    });

    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [GameBoardComponent],
      providers: [{ provide: GameService, useValue: gameServiceSpy }]
    }).compileComponents();

    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(GameBoardComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    mockGameService = TestBed.inject(GameService) as jasmine.SpyObj<GameService>;
  });

  it('should handle cell click', () => {
    fixture.detectChanges();
    const firstCell = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('[data-testid="cell-0"]'));
    
    firstCell.nativeElement.click();
    
    expect(mockGameService.makeMove).toHaveBeenCalledWith(0);
  });
});
```

### E2E Testing Configuration
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Playwright Configuration Enhancements:**
- Existing configuration supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Health check smoke test already functional
- Need expansion for game flow and navigation testing
- Accessibility testing integration required
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

**E2E Test Scenarios Required:**
1. **Game Flow Testing:** Complete tic-tac-toe game from start to finish
2. **Navigation Testing:** Route navigation and deep linking
3. **Health Check Validation:** Comprehensive health endpoint testing
4. **Accessibility Testing:** Screen reader and keyboard navigation
5. **Error Handling:** Network failures and invalid states

### Testing Script Configuration
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

**Required Package Script Updates:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "nx run-many --target=test --all",           // Existing: unit+integration
    "test:unit": "nx run-many --target=test --all --testNamePattern='(?!\\.integration\\.)'",
    "test:integration": "nx run-many --target=test --all --testNamePattern='\\.integration\\.'",
    "test:e2e": "nx run ui-e2e:e2e",                    // Existing
    "test:watch": "nx run-many --target=test --all --watch",
    "test:coverage": "nx run-many --target=test --all --coverage"
  }
}
```

### Testing Execution Order and Guidelines
Testing should follow this execution order for optimal development workflow:

1. **Unit Tests** (`pnpm test:unit`): Fast feedback loop for individual components
2. **Integration Tests** (`pnpm test:integration`): Verify component interactions
3. **Build Validation** (`pnpm build`): Ensure code compiles correctly
4. **E2E Tests** (`pnpm test:e2e`): End-to-end user journey validation

### Coverage and Quality Gates
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Combined unit + integration coverage ≥85%
- Individual project coverage reporting
- Coverage reports in text, HTML, and LCOV formats
- Failed coverage should block CI/CD when implemented

**Quality Gates:**
- All unit tests must pass before integration tests
- Integration tests must pass before E2E tests
- Linting must pass (`pnpm lint`) before testing
- Build must succeed (`pnpm build`) before E2E tests
