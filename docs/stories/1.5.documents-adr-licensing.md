# Story 1.5: Documentation, ADRs, and Licensing

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team and open source contributors,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 successfully established comprehensive testing infrastructure across all testing layers (unit, integration, E2E). The testing documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md was expanded significantly and provides a solid foundation for this story's documentation enhancements. All quality gates are operational and coverage thresholds are enforced.

### Architecture Documentation Context
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/index.md]

The project already has extensive architecture documentation in `docs/ui-architecture/` covering:
- Frontend tech stack rationale
- Project structure and organization  
- Component architecture standards
- Testing requirements and patterns
- Developer standards and coding guidelines

**Note**: The acceptance criteria calls for ADR directory under `docs/architecture/` but existing architecture docs are in `docs/ui-architecture/`. The ADR directory should be created separately to document high-level architectural decisions while the existing ui-architecture folder contains detailed implementation guidelines.

### Technology Stack Decisions to Document in ADRs
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

**ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection**
Document the rationale for:
- **Angular 17+**: Modern standalone components, signals, excellent TypeScript support
- **Nx**: Monorepo tooling, modular architecture, code sharing, integrated testing
- **Vite**: Fast HMR, modern bundling, optimal for Angular 17+
- **PNPM**: Efficient disk usage, fast installs, workspace support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid prototyping, consistent design system, small bundle
- **Angular Signals**: Lightweight, built-in, optimal for simple game state
- **Jest + Playwright**: Comprehensive testing coverage with fast execution

**ADR-002: Project Structure and Monorepo Organization**
Document the rationale for:
- Apps vs Libraries separation
- Game engine as separate library (`libs/engine`)
- Shared utilities library (`libs/shared`)
- UI application structure (`apps/ui`)
- E2E testing as separate application (`apps/ui-e2e`)

### Legal and Licensing Requirements
Based on project dependencies and open source nature:

**MIT License Requirements:**
- Permissive license allowing commercial use
- Requires copyright notice and license text in distributions
- Compatible with all project dependencies
- Standard choice for Angular/JavaScript projects

**NOTICE File Contents:**
- Copyright notices for the project
- Third-party dependency attributions
- Angular, Nx, Tailwind CSS, and other major dependency notices
- Attribution requirements for any included assets or code

**License Header Requirements:**
For key source files, consider adding:
```typescript
/*

```

### Contributing Guidelines Enhancement Areas
[Source: CONTRIBUTING.md (current state)]

**Current State Analysis:**
- Quality gates well documented (`pnpm validate`, `pnpm e2e`)
- Coverage requirements specified (≥85%)
- Basic code standards outlined
- Testing execution order documented

**Enhancement Areas for Story 1.5:**
- **Testing Layer Expectations**: Detailed requirements for unit vs integration vs E2E
- **ADR Process**: When and how to create Architecture Decision Records
- **Code Review Standards**: What reviewers should check
- **Documentation Standards**: When to update docs
- **Legal Compliance**: License header requirements

### Testing Layer Documentation Requirements

**Unit Testing Expectations:**
- Individual component and service testing in isolation
- Mock all external dependencies
- Use jasmine spies for Angular service testing
- Include `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection
