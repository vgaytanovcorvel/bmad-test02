# Story 2.5: Terminal-State Detection and Result

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer implementing the tic-tac-toe game engine,
**I want** comprehensive terminal state detection and result determination,
**so that** the engine can accurately identify when games end (win/draw), determine winners, and provide complete final game state information including winning lines.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: `isTerminal(state)` returns true for win or draw; `winner(state)` returns winning player or null.
2: Terminal state includes the final board, last move, and winning line (if any).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.4 successfully implemented comprehensive move validation and turn alternation with immutable state transitions. The engine now has complete legal move detection, robust move application with error handling, and proper player alternation. Key established patterns include: GameError class for enhanced error handling, immutable state object creation, board size compatibility for both 3x3 and 4x4, and comprehensive test coverage. All 238 engine tests are passing successfully.

### Game Engine Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-002-project-structure.md#game-engine-as-separate-library]

**Framework Independence Requirements:**
- Engine methods must be pure functions with no side effects
- All methods should be deterministic for given inputs
- No dependencies on UI frameworks or external libraries
- State objects must be immutable - methods return new state instances
- Clear separation between game rules and UI presentation logic

**Library Layer Structure:**
- `libs/engine/` contains all game logic, rules, and state management
- Engine interfaces define contracts for game operations
- Public API barrel exports maintain stable interface boundaries
- Unit tests assert interface contracts and immutability patterns

### Terminal State Detection Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-core-engine-perfect-computer-opponent.md]

**Terminal State Specifications:**
- `isTerminal(state)` returns true for win or draw conditions
- `winner(state)` returns winning player or null for draws
- Terminal state includes final board, last move, and winning line
- Must work across both 3x3 and 4x4 board sizes

**Result Information Requirements:**
- Complete terminal state information in GameState object
- Immutable final board state with all moves applied
- Winning line coordinates for display and analysis
- Accurate endTime timestamp for game duration calculation

### Type System Integration
[Source: libs/shared/src/lib/types/ from Story 2.1]

**Available Types for Terminal Detection:**
```typescript
export type Player = 'X' | 'O';
export type GameStatus = 'playing' | 'won' | 'draw';

export interface GameState {
  readonly board: readonly Cell[];
  readonly currentPlayer: Player;
  readonly moveHistory: readonly Move[];
  readonly status: GameStatus;
  readonly winner: Player | null;
  readonly winningLine: readonly number[] | null;
  readonly config: GameConfig;
  readonly startTime: number;
  readonly endTime?: number;
}

export interface GameConfig {
  readonly boardSize: BoardSize;
  readonly kInRow: number;
  readonly firstPlayer: Player;
  readonly mode: GameMode;
}
```

**Engine Interface Contracts:**
[Source: libs/engine/src/lib/interfaces/engine.interface.ts]
```typescript
export interface Engine {
  isTerminal(state: GameState): boolean;
  winner(state: GameState): Player | null;
  kInRow(state: GameState): number[][];
  // ... other existing methods
}
```

### Implementation Approach
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#enterprise-complexity]

**Method Structure Guidelines:**
- Maximum method length: 20 lines per enterprise standards
- Each method should have single, clear responsibility
- Extract complex logic into smaller focused functions
- Use descriptive method names explaining purpose

**Terminal Detection Algorithms:**
```typescript
isTerminal(state: GameState): boolean {
  // Check win condition using existing kInRow logic
  const winningLines = this.kInRow(state);
  if (winningLines.length > 0) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Check draw condition (board full, no winner)
  const boardSize = state.config.boardSize;  
  const totalCells = boardSize * boardSize;
  const filledCells = state.board.filter(cell => cell !== null).length;
  
  return filledCells === totalCells;
}

winner(state: GameState): Player | null {
  // Only return winner for terminal states
  if (!this.isTerminal(state)) {
    return null; // or throw error based on interface contract
  }
  
  // Use existing kInRow to find winning lines
  const winningLines = this.kInRow(state);
  if (winningLines.length === 0) {
    return null; // Draw game
  }
  
  // Return player from first winning position
  const firstWinningPosition = winningLines[0][0];
  return state.board[firstWinningPosition] as Player;
}
```

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-002-project-structure.md#library-layer]

**Implementation Files (extend these):**
- `libs/engine/src/lib/implementations/tic-tac-toe-engine.ts` - Add isTerminal and winner methods
- `libs/engine/src/lib/interfaces/engine.interface.ts` - Interface already includes methods
- `libs/engine/src/lib/implementations/index.ts` - Update barrel exports (if needed)

**Test Files (extend these):**
- `libs/engine/src/lib/implementations/tic-tac-toe-engine.spec.ts` - Add terminal detection tests
- `libs/engine/src/lib/interfaces/engine.interface.spec.ts` - Add interface contract tests

### Terminal State Information Completeness
[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-core-engine-perfect-computer-opponent.md Story 2.5 AC 2]

**Complete Terminal State Requirements:**
```typescript
// Terminal GameState must include:
interface TerminalGameState extends GameState {
  readonly status: 'won' | 'draw'; // Never 'playing'
  readonly winner: Player | null; // Player for wins, null for draws
  readonly winningLine: readonly number[] | null; // Coordinates for wins, null for draws
  readonly endTime: number; // Timestamp when game ended
  readonly moveHistory: readonly Move[]; // Complete move sequence including final move
  readonly board: readonly Cell[]; // Final board state
}
```

**Terminal State Creation Pattern:**
```typescript
private createTerminalState(state: GameState, status: 'won' | 'draw', winner: Player | null, winningLine: number[] | null): GameState {
  return {
    ...state,
    status,
    winner,
    winningLine,
    endTime: Date.now()
  };
}
```

### Cross-Board Size Terminal Detection  
[Source: Story 2.1 Engine Types and Interfaces, Story 2.3 4x4 Logic]

**Board Size Configuration:**
- 3x3 Board: 9 positions (indices 0-8), k=3
- 4x4 Board: 16 positions (indices 0-15), k=3
- BoardSize determined by `state.config.boardSize`
- Total cells = `boardSize * boardSize`

**Draw Detection Algorithm:**
```typescript
private isDraw(state: GameState): boolean {
  const boardSize = state.config.boardSize;
  const totalCells = boardSize * boardSize;
  const filledCells = state.board.filter(cell => cell !== null).length;
  
  // Draw only if board is full AND no winning lines exist
  return filledCells === totalCells && this.kInRow(state).length === 0;
}
```

**Win Detection Integration:**
```typescript
private hasWinner(state: GameState): boolean {
  return this.kInRow(state).length > 0;
}

private getWinner(state: GameState): Player | null {
  const winningLines = this.kInRow(state);
  if (winningLines.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }
  
  // Return player from first cell of first winning line
  const firstWinningCell = winningLines[0][0];
  return state.board[firstWinningCell] as Player;
}
```

### Integration with Existing Engine Methods
[Source: libs/engine/src/lib/implementations/ from Stories 2.1-2.4]

**Method Integration Strategy:**
- `isTerminal()` leverages existing `kInRow()` for win detection
- `winner()` reuses win detection logic from `kInRow()` method
- Terminal detection integrates with existing board size routing patterns
- State transitions use established immutability patterns from previous stories

**Integration with Move Application:**
```typescript
applyMove(state: GameState, move: Move): GameState {
  // Apply move using existing logic
  const newState = this.createNewStateWithMove(state, move);
  
  // Use new terminal detection to update status
  if (this.isTerminal(newState)) {
    return this.createTerminalState(
      newState,
      this.hasWinner(newState) ? 'won' : 'draw',
      this.winner(newState),
      this.getWinningLine(newState)
    );
  }
  
  return newState;
}
```

**Dependency Integration:**
```typescript
// isTerminal uses existing methods
isTerminal(state: GameState): boolean {
  return this.hasWinner(state) || this.isDraw(state);
}

// winner uses existing kInRow implementation
winner(state: GameState): Player | null {
  const winningLines = this.kInRow(state); // Existing method
  return winningLines.length > 0 ? this.getPlayerFromLine(state, winningLines[0]) : null;
}
```

### Performance Optimization Guidelines
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#performance-caching]

**Efficiency for Terminal Detection:**
- Use existing `kInRow()` method to avoid duplicate win detection logic
- Cache board size calculation: `const totalCells = boardSize * boardSize`
- Early exit: check for wins before checking for draws
- Minimize array filtering operations for board full detection

**Algorithm Optimization:**
```typescript
isTerminal(state: GameState): boolean {
  // Early exit: check win condition first (most common terminal state)
  if (this.kInRow(state).length > 0) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Only check draw if no win (more expensive operation)
  const boardSize = state.config.boardSize;
  const totalCells = boardSize * boardSize;
  
  // Efficient check: count null cells instead of filtering
  let emptyCells = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < totalCells; i++) {
    if (state.board[i] === null) {
      emptyCells++;
      if (emptyCells > 0) {
        return false; // Early exit: game still ongoing
      }
    }
  }
  
  return true; // Board is full, no winner = draw
}
```

### Testing

### Unit Testing Strategy  
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md#unit-testing]

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- 100% coverage on isTerminal and winner methods
- All terminal and non-terminal scenarios tested
- Board size compatibility tested for both 3x3 and 4x4
- Integration tests with existing engine methods (kInRow, applyMove)
- Edge cases and error conditions tested

**Test Categories:**

1. **Terminal State Detection Tests:**
   - Won games: isTerminal returns true
   - Draw games: isTerminal returns true  
   - Ongoing games: isTerminal returns false
   - Empty boards: isTerminal returns false
   - Partial boards: isTerminal returns false
   - Both 3x3 and 4x4 board sizes

2. **Winner Determination Tests:**
   - Win scenarios: winner returns correct player
   - Draw scenarios: winner returns null
   - Ongoing games: winner returns null (or throws error based on implementation)
   - Different winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals)
   - Multiple winning lines: winner returns first detected

3. **Cross-Board Size Tests:**
   - 3x3 terminal detection: 9 cells, k=3
   - 4x4 terminal detection: 16 cells, k=3  
   - Board size routing correctness
   - Terminal detection adapts to board configuration

4. **Integration Tests:**
   - Terminal detection with existing kInRow method
   - Winner determination using existing win detection
   - State transitions in applyMove using terminal detection
   - Consistency between isTerminal and winner results

5. **Edge Case Tests:**
   - Multiple winning lines scenarios
   - Early vs late game termination
   - Empty vs full board scenarios
   - Invalid or edge board configurations
