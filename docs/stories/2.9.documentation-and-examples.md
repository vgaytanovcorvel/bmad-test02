# Story 2.9: Documentation and Examples

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer implementing the tic-tac-toe game engine,
**I want** comprehensive documentation in `libs/engine` README describing public APIs, state shape, and example usage, with illustrative unit tests as examples and ADR updates capturing engine design choices,
**so that** I can quickly understand how to use the engine APIs, integrate with different board sizes, and implement proper usage patterns without having to reverse-engineer the interface contracts or design decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Add README in `libs/engine` describing public APIs, state shape, and example usage.
2: Add illustrative unit tests as examples of engine usage for both board sizes.
3: ADR entry updated to capture engine design choices (k-in-row scanning strategy, immutability approach).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.8 is currently in Draft status focusing on performance optimization with efficient inner loops, timing assertions, and immutability lint rules. The engine now has a solid foundation through stories 2.1-2.7 with complete type systems, k-in-row logic for both board sizes, move validation, terminal state detection, and comprehensive configuration management. All 264 engine tests are passing with established patterns including immutable state transitions, comprehensive error handling, and robust integration between engine components.

### Documentation Requirements and Standards
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#documentation]

**JSDoc Requirements:**
- All public interfaces must have comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Include parameter descriptions, return value descriptions, and examples
- Document error conditions with `@throws` tags
- Include `@example` sections for complex interfaces
- Use `@since` tags for version tracking

**README Documentation Standards:**
- Clear API overview with usage examples
- Installation and setup instructions
- Code examples for common use cases
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections
- Links to related documentation

**Example Documentation Pattern:**
```typescript
/**
 * Core game engine interface for tic-tac-toe games.
 * Provides pure functional methods for game state management.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const engine = new TicTacToeEngine();
 * const config = { boardSize: 3, kInRow: 3, firstPlayer: 'X', mode: 'human-vs-human' };
 * const initialState = engine.initialState(config);
 * ```
 * 
 * @since 2.1.0
 */
export interface Engine {
  // ... interface methods
}
```

### Current Engine API Structure
[Source: docs/stories/2.1.engine-types-and-interfaces.md, docs/stories/2.7.configuration-and-mode-selection.md]

**Core Interfaces to Document:**
- `Engine` interface with methods: `initialState(config)`, `legalMoves(state)`, `applyMove(state, move)`, `isTerminal(state)`, `winner(state)`, `kInRow(state)`
- `EngineFactory` with `create3x3Engine()` and `create4x4Engine()` methods
- `GameState` type with all properties including board, currentPlayer, winner, status, etc.
- `GameConfig` type with boardSize, kInRow, firstPlayer, mode options
- `Move`, `Player`, `Cell`, `GameMode`, `Result` types from shared library

**Key Implementation Features:**
- Immutable state transitions with readonly arrays and objects
- Factory pattern for engine creation with validation
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid moves and configurations
- K-in-row detection for both 3x3 (k=3) and 4x4 (k=3) board sizes
- Terminal state detection with winner determination
- Move validation with legal move generation

### Engine Factory Usage Patterns
[Source: docs/stories/2.7.configuration-and-mode-selection.md]

**Factory Pattern Examples to Document:**
```typescript
// 3x3 Engine Creation
const engine3x3 = EngineFactory.create3x3Engine();
const config3x3 = { boardSize: 3, kInRow: 3, firstPlayer: 'X', mode: 'human-vs-human' };
const gameState = engine3x3.initialState(config3x3);

// 4x4 Engine Creation  
const engine4x4 = EngineFactory.create4x4Engine();
const config4x4 = { boardSize: 4, kInRow: 3, firstPlayer: 'O', mode: 'human-vs-computer' };
const gameState = engine4x4.initialState(config4x4);
```

**Complete Game Workflow Examples:**
- Engine creation and initialization
- Move application and state transitions
- Legal move generation and validation
- Terminal state detection and winner determination
- Error handling for invalid operations

### K-in-Row Strategy Documentation Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-2-core-engine-perfect-computer-opponent.md]

**Design Choices to Document in ADR:**
- K-in-row scanning strategy across rows, columns, and diagonals
- Efficient detection algorithms avoiding unnecessary allocations
- Immutability patterns with readonly types and state copying
- Board representation and indexing strategies
- Performance optimization approaches while maintaining readability

**Implementation Details to Capture:**
- 3x3 board k=3 detection (traditional tic-tac-toe)
- 4x4 board k=3 detection (connect 3 in larger grid)
- Winning line coordinate calculation and storage
- Tie/draw detection when no legal moves remain
