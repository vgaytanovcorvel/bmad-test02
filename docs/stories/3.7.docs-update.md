### Controls and Interaction Documentation
[Source: docs/stories/3.2.board-and-interaction.md, docs/stories/3.3.mode-and-size-controls.md]

**Board Interaction Controls:**
- **Click to Play**: Click any empty cell to place X or O marker
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate between cells, Space/Enter to select
- **Visual Feedback**: Cells highlight on hover, current player indicator shows whose turn
- **Game State Display**: Real-time status updates show current player, win conditions, or draw

**Game Mode Controls:**
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between "Human vs Human" and "Human vs Computer"
- **Mode Persistence**: Selected mode maintained across games until manually changed
- **Computer Player**: AI opponent makes optimal moves when in Human vs Computer mode
- **Turn Alternation**: Automatic turn switching in Human vs Human mode

**Board Size Controls:**
- **Size Selection**: Choose between different board dimensions
- **Auto Reset**: Changing board size automatically triggers new game
- **Layout Preservation**: Responsive design maintains square cells across all sizes
- **State Management**: Board size change resets game but preserves mode selection

**Game Reset Controls:**
- **New Game Button**: Resets board state and move history
- **Mode Preservation**: New game maintains current mode and size settings
- **State Clearing**: Clears winner, highlights, and move history
- **Player Reset**: Returns to first player (typically X) for new game

### Optional Visual Enhancements Documentation
[Source: docs/stories/3.5.optional-visual-enhancements.md]

**CSS Transition Features:**
- **Animation Duration**: Subtle CSS-only transitions ‚â§200ms maximum
- **Performance**: No JavaScript animations, CSS transforms only
- **Customization**: Transitions can be disabled by removing CSS class
- **Simplicity**: No reduced-motion media query logic required in v1.3
- **Implementation**: Class-based system allows easy enable/disable

**3D Library Exclusion:**
- **Scope Limitation**: No external 3D libraries included in v1.3 release
- **Future Consideration**: 3D enhancements planned for future versions
- **Performance Focus**: Current implementation prioritizes load time and compatibility
- **CSS-Only Approach**: All visual enhancements use standard CSS properties

**Customization Instructions:**
```css
/* To disable transitions, remove or comment out: */
.game-cell {
  /* transition: transform 0.15s ease-in-out; */
}

/* To enable enhanced animations: */
.game-cell:hover {
  /* transform: scale(1.02); */
}
```
