- 🛠️ Technology Stack: Complete technology listing  
- 🚀 Quick Start: Installation and development commands
- 🎮 Game Features: Comprehensive feature documentation
- 🧪 Testing: Complete testing strategy and commands

- Deployment section needs comprehensive static hosting procedures
- Accessibility documentation needs consolidation and clarity
- Reduced motion support needs explicit documentation

### Architecture Documentation Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-003-engine-design.md, docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md]

**Engine Design and Exhaustive Search Rationale:**
- **Pure Function Architecture**: Engine uses immutable state and pure functions for predictability
- **K-in-Row Algorithm**: Configurable scanning algorithm handles 3x3 and 4x4 boards with k=3
- **Exhaustive Search Performance**: For 3x3/4x4 boards, exhaustive move evaluation completes <10ms
- **Position-based Board Representation**: Efficient grid-to-position mapping enables fast scanning
- **Factory Pattern**: EngineFactory provides consistent configuration for different board sizes
- **Immutable State Benefits**: Time-travel debugging, predictable behavior, comprehensive testability

**Performance Characteristics:**
- 3x3 board: Maximum 9 positions to evaluate, typically <1ms for optimal move calculation
- 4x4 board: Maximum 16 positions with k=3 winning condition, typically <5ms response time
- Algorithm complexity: O(n²) for complete board scan, O(k) for individual line checks
- Memory usage: Immutable state creates minimal garbage collection overhead for small boards

**Future Extension Strategy:**
- Architecture supports larger boards (5x5, 6x6+) with same algorithm
- Performance path for large boards: memoized minimax with transposition tables
- Configuration injection via SUPPORTED_CONFIGS constant enables easy board size expansion
- Pure function design allows optimization, caching, and parallelization

### Deployment Documentation Requirements
[Source: vercel.json, netlify.toml, package.json build scripts]

**Current Build Infrastructure:**
- Build command: `npm run build:ui:static` for static hosting optimization
- Output directory: `dist/apps/ui/browser/` with SPA routing support
- Build hash injection: Automatic via `tools/build-hash.js` for deployment tracking
- Environment detection: Automatic production/development environment configuration

**Deployment Configuration Files:**
- `vercel.json`: SPA routing with fallback to `/index.html`, optimized build settings
- `netlify.toml`: Node.js 18+, PNPM 8+, redirect rules for Angular routing
- Health endpoint: `/health` for deployment verification and status monitoring

**Deployment Verification Requirements:**
- Health check: Green status indicator and build hash display
- Route verification: `/`, `/health`, `/credits` all accessible
- SPA routing: Direct navigation works without 404 errors
- Static assets: CSS, JS, and asset files load correctly

### Accessibility Implementation Context
[Source: apps/ui/src/styles/globals.scss, docs/stories/3.*.md, docs/prd/requirements.md]

**Current Accessibility Features:**
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) throughout application
- **ARIA Labels**: Game board and controls have appropriate ARIA attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with Tab/Shift+Tab navigation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Game state communicated via semantic markup and ARIA
- **Table Accessibility**: Credits page uses proper table semantics with scope attributes

**Reduced Motion Support:**
- **CSS Media Query**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` implemented
- **Animation Override**: `.transitions-enabled` class system for disabling animations
- **Performance Optimized**: CSS-only animations ≤200ms duration for subtle effects
- **User Control**: Animations can be disabled by removing CSS classes

**Current Accessibility Scope (v1.3):**
- Basic semantic HTML and ARIA implementation
- Keyboard navigation for essential interactions
- Reduced motion preference respect
- Screen reader compatibility for game state
- Future expansion planned for comprehensive WCAG compliance

**Accessibility Enhancement Path:**
- ARIA live regions for dynamic game state announcements
- Enhanced focus management and visual indicators
- Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- Advanced screen reader optimization

**Testing and Validation:**
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility verification (basic level)
- High contrast and reduced motion preference testing
- Accessibility tree validation for semantic structure
