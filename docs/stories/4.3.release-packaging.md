## Status
Reviewed

## Story
**As a** developer or release manager,
**I want** a validated production build process that can be served locally and deployed to static hosting platforms,
**so that** I can verify the application works correctly in production mode and have clear deployment procedures.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Production build served locally (verify `/`, `/health`, `/credits`).
2: Manual deploy steps (e.g., Vercel/Netlify) documented.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Production Build Validation and Local Serving** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Execute production build process using `npm run build:ui:static`
  - [ ] Verify build output directory structure in `dist/apps/ui/browser/`
  - [ ] Start local static server using `npm run preview`
  - [ ] Validate all key routes: `/`, `/health`, `/credits` load correctly
  - [ ] Verify build hash injection is working in health endpoint
  - [ ] Test SPA routing with direct navigation to routes
  - [ ] Validate static assets (CSS, JS, images) load properly
  - [ ] Confirm no console errors or warnings in production build

- [ ] **Task 2: Deployment Procedure Documentation and Validation** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Test Vercel deployment using CLI: `vercel --prod`
  - [ ] Test Netlify deployment using CLI: `netlify deploy --prod`
  - [ ] Verify drag-and-drop deployment works for both platforms
  - [ ] Document step-by-step deployment procedures for both platforms
  - [ ] Create deployment verification checklist with route testing
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common deployment issues

  - [ ] Verify `vercel.json` configuration matches build output
  - [ ] Validate `netlify.toml` build settings and redirects
  - [ ] Test build hash injection system with `tools/build-hash.js`
  - [ ] Confirm static hosting SPA routing works correctly
  - [ ] Validate security headers are properly configured
  - [ ] Test caching configuration for static assets

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.2 successfully completed comprehensive documentation including deployment documentation for Vercel and Netlify. Health endpoint is functional with build hash display. The application structure and routing are stable. All routes (`/`, `/health`, `/credits`) are verified to work correctly. Build infrastructure is proven functional through previous story implementation.

### Build System Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/ADR-002-project-structure.md]

**Production Build Configuration:**
- **Build Command**: `npm run build:ui:static` - Optimized for static hosting deployment
- **Build Process**: Automated build hash injection via `tools/build-hash.js inject` → Angular build → hash restoration
- **Output Directory**: `dist/apps/ui/browser/` - Standard Angular static hosting structure
- **Build Optimization**: Angular production configuration with code splitting, minification, and tree shaking
- **Static Configuration**: Special "static" configuration optimized for SPA deployment to static hosts

**Build Hash System:**
- **Injection Script**: `tools/build-hash.js` manages build hash placeholder replacement
- **Hash Generation**: Timestamp + random bytes for unique build identification
- **Environment Integration**: Automatically injected into `environment.prod.ts` during build
- **Restoration**: Build process restores template state after build completion
- **Health Endpoint**: Build hash displayed in `/health` route for deployment verification

**Local Preview System:**
- **Preview Command**: `npm run preview` - Builds and serves static files locally
- **Static Server**: Nx serve-static command simulates production static hosting environment
- **SPA Routing**: Local server configured to handle Angular client-side routing
- **Production Simulation**: Identical behavior to deployed static hosting environment

### Deployment Infrastructure
[Source: vercel.json, netlify.toml, package.json]

**Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`):**
- **Build Command**: `npm run build:ui:static` - Uses static optimized build
- **Output Directory**: `dist/apps/ui/browser` - Angular production output
- **Install Command**: `pnpm install` - Uses PNPM for faster dependency installation
- **SPA Routing**: Rewrites all routes to `/index.html` for client-side routing
- **Framework**: Set to `null` to disable framework detection and use custom build
- **Functions**: Node.js runtime configuration for potential future API routes

**Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`):**
- **Build Settings**: Node.js 18+, PNPM 8+, `npm run build:ui:static` build command
- **Publish Directory**: `dist/apps/ui/browser` matching Angular output structure
- **SPA Redirects**: `/*` → `/index.html` with 200 status for client-side routing
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, frame options, content type, HSTS configured
- **Caching Strategy**: Static assets cached for 1 year with immutable headers
- **Performance**: CSS/JS files cached with content hashing for optimal loading

**Deployment Verification Requirements:**
- **Route Accessibility**: All routes (`/`, `/health`, `/credits`) must load without errors
- **Build Hash Display**: Health endpoint must show correct build hash and timestamp
- **SPA Routing**: Direct navigation to routes must work without 404 errors
- **Asset Loading**: CSS, JavaScript, and static assets must load with correct MIME types
- **Console Clean**: No console errors or warnings in production deployment

### Project Structure and Build Output
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-002-project-structure.md]

**Build Output Structure:**
```
dist/apps/ui/browser/
├── index.html                    # Main SPA entry point
├── main-[hash].js               # Application bundle with content hash
├── polyfills-[hash].js          # Browser compatibility polyfills
├── styles-[hash].css            # Compiled and optimized styles
├── 3rdpartylicenses.txt         # Third-party license attributions
├── assets/                      # Static assets and resources
└── [other hashed files]         # Additional chunks and assets
```

**File Structure Alignment:**
- **Static Assets**: All assets properly referenced with correct paths
- **Content Hashing**: JavaScript and CSS files include content hashes for cache busting
- **License Compliance**: Third-party licenses automatically included in build output
- **SPA Structure**: Single `index.html` entry point for client-side routing
- **Asset Optimization**: Images, fonts, and other assets optimized for production

**Build Process Integration:**
- **Pre-build**: Build hash injection into environment configuration
- **Build**: Angular production optimization with static hosting configuration
- **Post-build**: Environment template restoration for development continuity
- **Verification**: Output directory structure matches deployment configuration

### Route and Health Endpoint Implementation
[Source: apps/ui/src/app/app.routes.ts, apps/ui/src/app/pages/health/]

**Application Routes:**
- **`/`** (default): Main game page with full tic-tac-toe functionality
- **`/health`**: Health check endpoint with build information and system status
- **`/credits`**: Credits page with dependency attributions and license information
- **SPA Fallback**: All undefined routes redirect to main game page

**Health Endpoint Functionality:**
- **Build Hash Display**: Shows injected build hash for deployment verification
- **Status Indicator**: Green/red status indicator for quick health assessment  
- **Environment Info**: Production/development environment detection
- **Route Validation**: Confirms routing system is functioning correctly
- **Deployment Verification**: Primary endpoint for post-deployment validation

**Credits Page Integration:**
- **Dependency Table**: Complete list of all third-party dependencies with versions
- **License Links**: Direct links to LICENSE and NOTICE files
- **Attribution Compliance**: Proper attribution for all open source dependencies
- **Accessibility**: Semantic table structure with proper headers and scope attributes
