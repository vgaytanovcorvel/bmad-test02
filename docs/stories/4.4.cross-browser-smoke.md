### Frontend Technology Stack and Browser Compatibility
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md, docs/ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]

**Browser Support Requirements:**
- **Angular 17+**: Supports all modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Edge 90+, Safari 14+)
- **TypeScript 5.x**: ES2022 transpilation ensures broad browser compatibility
- **Vite Build System**: Modern bundling with automatic polyfill injection for older browsers
- **Tailwind CSS 3.x**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, and modern CSS features with autoprefixer

**JavaScript Features Used:**
- **ES2022+ Features**: Optional chaining, nullish coalescing, private class fields
- **Angular Signals**: Modern reactivity (Angular 17+ built-in feature)
- **Standalone Components**: No NgModule complexity, direct imports
- **Native Async/Await**: Modern promise handling patterns

**CSS Technologies:**
- **Tailwind Utilities**: Comprehensive browser testing via Tailwind's compatibility matrix
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Modern browsers only (IE11+ support deprecated)
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Full modern browser support with proper fallbacks
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with standard breakpoints

### Application Routes and User Interface
[Source: apps/ui/src/app/app.routes.ts, docs/architecture/ADR-002-project-structure.md]

**Testing Routes:**
- **`/`** (Main Game Page): Full tic-tac-toe functionality with board interaction
  - Game board with 3x3 grid layout
  - Click interactions for cell selection
  - Player turn alternation (X and O)
  - Win/draw detection and display
  - Game reset functionality
- **`/health`**: Health check endpoint with build information
  - Build hash display for deployment verification
  - System status indicators
  - Environment information (production/development)
- **`/credits`**: Credits page with dependency attributions
  - Table of all third-party dependencies with versions
  - Links to LICENSE and NOTICE files
  - Accessible table semantics with proper headers

**UI Components to Test:**
- **Game Board Component**: 3x3 grid with clickable cells
- **Game Controls**: Reset button and game status display
- **Health Check Component**: Build information and status indicators
- **Credits Table**: Dependency list with licensing information
- **Navigation**: SPA routing between all pages

### Responsive Design and Mobile Considerations
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md, docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md]

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- **Mobile**: 375px-767px (primary mobile testing viewport)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1023px
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ 

**Mobile-Specific Features:**
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch target size for accessibility
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Proper mobile viewport configuration
- **Touch Interactions**: Native touch events for game cell selection
- **Orientation Support**: Both portrait and landscape modes
- **Text Scaling**: Readable text sizes across all screen sizes

**Tailwind Mobile-First Design:**
- **Mobile-First Utilities**: Base styles optimized for mobile
- **Responsive Modifiers**: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoint prefixes
- **Touch-Friendly Spacing**: Adequate padding and margins for touch interfaces
- **Readable Typography**: Optimized text sizes and line heights

### Testing Procedures and Browser-Specific Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md#testing-infrastructure]

**Cross-Browser Testing Protocol:**
1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all user interactions work correctly
2. **Visual Testing**: Check layout, styling, and visual consistency
3. **Performance Testing**: Measure loading times and responsiveness
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Validate screen reader and keyboard navigation

**Browser-Specific Considerations:**
- **Chrome**: Baseline reference browser for comparison
- **Firefox**: Gecko engine differences, especially CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Edge**: Chromium-based but may have Microsoft-specific behaviors
- **Safari**: WebKit engine, potential iOS-specific touch behaviors
- **Mobile**: Touch events, viewport handling, performance constraints

**Issue Documentation Requirements:**
- **Screenshots**: Visual comparisons across browsers when issues found
- **Console Logs**: JavaScript errors or warnings specific to browsers
- **Performance Metrics**: Loading time differences between browsers
- **Accessibility Issues**: Screen reader or keyboard navigation problems

### Build System and Static Asset Delivery
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md, docs/stories/4.3.release-packaging.md]

**Production Build Characteristics:**
- **Optimized Bundles**: Code splitting, minification, tree shaking applied
- **Content Hashing**: JavaScript and CSS files include content hashes for caching
- **Static Assets**: Images, fonts properly optimized and served
- **SPA Configuration**: Client-side routing handled correctly by all browsers

**Deployment Configuration:**
- **Build Output**: `dist/apps/ui/browser/` contains optimized static files
- **Routing**: All undefined routes redirect to main game page (SPA behavior)
- **Caching Strategy**: Static assets cached with proper headers
- **Performance**: Bundle size optimized for fast loading

### Quality Assurance Standards
[Source: docs/ui-architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]

**Cross-Browser Testing Requirements:**
- **Consistent Functionality**: All features work identically across browsers
- **Visual Consistency**: Layout and styling appear correctly across browsers
- **Performance Standards**: Loading times within acceptable ranges
- **Error-Free Operation**: No console errors or JavaScript exceptions
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Screen readers and keyboard navigation work properly

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **Compatibility Matrix**: Document browser versions tested and support status
- **Known Issues List**: Any identified issues with severity classification
- **Workaround Documentation**: Solutions for any browser-specific issues found
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Loading time measurements across browsers
