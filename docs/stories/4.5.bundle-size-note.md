## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 4.4 completed comprehensive cross-browser testing with all browsers showing consistent functionality. Production build is confirmed stable and operational at both development (http://localhost:4200/) and production (http://localhost:4201/) endpoints. All routes (/, /health, /credits) are functional, and the build system with content hashing is working correctly.

**Development vs Production Differences:**
- **Development Build**: Unminified code with source maps and debugging tools
- **Production Build**: Minified, tree-shaken, optimized for performance
- **Bundle Analysis**: Production build provides accurate size measurements
- **Performance Characteristics**: Production build optimized for initial load time

### Bundle Size Analysis Tools and Methodology
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md#build-and-development-tools]

**Measurement Tools:**
- **Vite Bundle Analyzer**: Built-in analysis capabilities for chunk visualization
- **File System Analysis**: Direct measurement of dist/ output files
- **Gzip Compression**: Server-like compression measurement for realistic network transfer
- **Network Tab Analysis**: Browser developer tools for runtime measurement

**Measurement Standards:**
- **Baseline Target**: <500KB gzipped for simple tic-tac-toe application
- **Extended Target**: <1MB gzipped if additional libraries (Babylon.js, etc.) added
- **Measurement Method**: Sum of all JavaScript and CSS files in production build
- **Compression**: Gzip Level 6 compression for realistic server delivery simulation

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **File-by-File Breakdown**: Individual chunk sizes and purposes
- **Dependency Attribution**: Which libraries contribute most to bundle size
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Areas for potential size reduction
- **Performance Budget**: Recommended size limits for future features

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md#consequences]

**Bundle Size Monitoring:**
- **Baseline Documentation**: Record current measurements for future comparison
- **Regression Prevention**: Size increase alerts for new features or dependencies
- **Performance Budget**: Establish limits for future development
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic bundle analysis and optimization opportunities

**Optimization Techniques Available:**
- **Dynamic Imports**: Code splitting for route-based loading
- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused Angular modules and third-party code
- **CSS Purging**: Tailwind CSS unused utility removal
- **Asset Optimization**: Image compression and format optimization
- **Dependency Analysis**: Replace large dependencies with smaller alternatives

**Performance Goals:**
- **Initial Load**: Fast first page load under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Bundle Size**: Minimize JavaScript payload for mobile users
- **Caching Strategy**: Leverage content hashing for efficient browser caching
- **Progressive Loading**: Essential functionality loads first, enhancements later

### Project Structure and File Organization
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-002-project-structure.md]

**Library Structure Impact on Bundle:**
- **Engine Library**: Pure TypeScript game logic (minimal bundle impact)
- **Shared Library**: Common types and utilities (tree-shakable)
- **UI Application**: Angular components and services (main bundle contributor)

**Monorepo Benefits for Bundle Analysis:**
- **Nx Dependency Graph**: Visualize which libraries contribute to final bundle
- **Build Optimization**: Intelligent caching and only build what changed
- **Code Sharing**: Shared types prevent code duplication across libs

**File Structure for Performance:**
```
dist/apps/ui/browser/
├── main.[hash].js          # Application code and Angular framework
├── polyfills.[hash].js     # Browser compatibility polyfills  
├── styles.[hash].css       # Compiled Tailwind and component styles
├── assets/                 # Static assets with content hashing
└── index.html              # Entry point with optimized resource loading
```

### Performance Budget and Recommendations
[Source: docs/architecture/ADR-001-tech-stack.md#consequences]

**Current Architecture Expectations:**
- **Angular 17+ Overhead**: Modern framework with optimized bundle size
- **Tailwind CSS**: Minimal impact due to PurgeCSS removing unused utilities
- **Game Engine**: Lightweight TypeScript logic with minimal runtime impact
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies in current implementation

**Future Optimization Opportunities:**
- **Route-Based Code Splitting**: Split credits and health pages into separate chunks
- **Lazy Loading**: Load non-essential features on demand
- **Angular Optimization**: OnPush change detection and standalone components already implemented
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and fonts if added in future releases
- **Bundle Analysis Integration**: Add automated bundle size monitoring to CI/CD pipeline
