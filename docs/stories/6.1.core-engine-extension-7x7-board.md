# Story 6.1: Core Engine Extension for 7x7 Board Support

## Status
Not Started

## Story
**As a** software engineer evaluating AI-assisted development capabilities,
**I want** the tic-tac-toe engine to support 7x7 board configuration with 4-in-a-row victory conditions,
**So that** I can observe BMAD methodology's effectiveness in extending established game logic while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1: **Type System Extension** - `BoardSize` type updated to include `7`, supporting `BoardSize = 3 | 4 | 7`
2: **Configuration Support** - `GameConfig` validation accepts `boardSize: 7` with `kInRow: 4` combination
3: **Engine Initialization** - `TicTacToeEngine.initialState()` creates 49-cell board (7x7) when `config.boardSize = 7`
4: **Factory Integration** - `EngineFactory` provides method for 7x7 engine creation following existing patterns

### Win Detection Requirements
5: **Row Detection** - `WinDetector.checkRows7x7()` method detects 4-in-a-row across all 7 rows using sliding window
6: **Column Detection** - `WinDetector.checkColumns7x7()` method detects 4-in-a-row across all 7 columns
7: **Diagonal Detection** - `WinDetector.checkDiagonals7x7()` method detects 4-in-a-row across main and anti-diagonals
8: **Integration** - `WinDetector.kInRow()` method routes to 7x7 methods when `boardSize = 7`

### Backward Compatibility Requirements
9: Existing 3x3 (k=3) and 4x4 (k=3) functionality continues to work unchanged
10: New 7x7 functionality follows existing `WinDetector` method naming and return patterns
11: `GameConfig` validation maintains existing rules for 3x3 and 4x4 boards
12: No breaking changes to public engine APIs or method signatures

### Quality Requirements
13: Comprehensive unit tests cover all 7x7 win scenarios (rows, columns, diagonals, edge cases)
14: Performance benchmarks ensure 7x7 initial move calculation <8 seconds
15: Integration tests verify cross-board-size functionality remains intact

## Epic Context

**Epic Goal:** Extend the existing tic-tac-toe engine and UI to support 7x7 board configuration with 4-in-a-row victory conditions, validating BMAD methodology's effectiveness in managing evolutionary changes to established codebases.

**Integration Points:**
- `TicTacToeEngine` - Core engine requiring board size support extension
- `WinDetector` - Win detection algorithms requiring 7x7 methods
- `EngineFactory` - Factory pattern requiring 7x7 configuration support
- `GameConfig` interface - Type system requiring validation extension
- Testing infrastructure - Unit and integration test coverage

## Technical Notes

**Algorithm Approach:** Implement sliding window pattern (size 4) similar to existing 4x4 implementation but adapted for 7x7 grid with more possible winning lines.

**Performance Consideration:** 7x7 board has significantly larger state space (49 positions vs 16 for 4x4) - optimize for initial moves and monitor computational complexity.

**Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow established patterns from `checkRows4x4()`, `checkColumns4x4()`, `checkDiagonals4x4()` methods in `WinDetector` class.

**Key Constraints:** Must maintain immutable state objects and pure functional approach established in existing engine architecture.

## Dev Notes

### 7x7 Win Detection Algorithm Specifications

**Row Detection (7x7, k=4):**
- 7 rows × 4 sliding windows per row = 28 possible row wins
- Window positions per row: [0,1,2,3], [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]
- Algorithm: Sliding window of size 4 across each row

**Column Detection (7x7, k=4):**
- 7 columns × 4 sliding windows per column = 28 possible column wins
- Window positions per column: similar vertical sliding pattern
- Algorithm: Sliding window of size 4 down each column

**Diagonal Detection (7x7, k=4):**
- Main diagonals: 8 possible diagonal wins (4 on each main diagonal direction)
- Anti-diagonals: 8 possible anti-diagonal wins
- Total diagonal wins: 16 possible diagonal combinations

**Board Size Routing Logic:**
```typescript
kInRow(state: GameState): number[][] {
  const boardSize = state.config.boardSize;
  
  if (boardSize === 3) {
    return [...this.checkRows(state.board), ...this.checkColumns(state.board), ...this.checkDiagonals(state.board)];
  } else if (boardSize === 4) {
    return [...this.checkRows4x4(state.board), ...this.checkColumns4x4(state.board), ...this.checkDiagonals4x4(state.board)];
  } else if (boardSize === 7) {
    return [...this.checkRows7x7(state.board), ...this.checkColumns7x7(state.board), ...this.checkDiagonals7x7(state.board)];
  }
  
  return [];
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

**Type System Updates:**
```typescript
// libs/shared/src/lib/types/game-types.ts
export type BoardSize = 3 | 4 | 7;
```

**GameConfig Validation Extension:**
```typescript
// libs/engine/src/lib/factories/engine-factory.ts
private static validateConfig(config: GameConfig): void {
  if (config.boardSize !== 3 && config.boardSize !== 4 && config.boardSize !== 7) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid board size: ${config.boardSize}. Must be 3, 4, or 7`);
  }
  
  if ((config.boardSize === 3 || config.boardSize === 4) && config.kInRow !== 3) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid k value: ${config.kInRow}. Must be 3 for 3x3 and 4x4 boards`);
  }
  
  if (config.boardSize === 7 && config.kInRow !== 4) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid k value: ${config.kInRow}. Must be 4 for 7x7 board`);
  }
}
```

### Unit Testing Strategy

**Required Test Coverage:**
1. **7x7 Row Win Detection Tests:**
   - All 28 possible row wins (7 rows × 4 positions each)
   - Edge cases: corner positions, boundary conditions
   - Multiple winning lines in same game state

2. **7x7 Column Win Detection Tests:**
   - All 28 possible column wins (7 columns × 4 positions each)
   - Vertical boundary edge cases
   - Overlapping win scenarios

3. **7x7 Diagonal Win Detection Tests:**
   - All 16 possible diagonal wins (8 main + 8 anti-diagonals)
   - Corner-to-corner scenarios
   - Diagonal edge cases and near-misses

4. **GameConfig Integration Tests:**
   - 7x7 board initialization creates 49-cell array
   - GameConfig validation accepts boardSize=7 with kInRow=4
   - Factory methods work correctly with 7x7 configuration

5. **Cross-Board Size Integration Tests:**
   - Verify 3x3 and 4x4 functionality unchanged after 7x7 implementation
   - Test board size routing logic in kInRow() method
   - Validate GameConfig integration across all board sizes

**Performance Testing:**
- Benchmark 7x7 initial move calculation time
- Verify <8 second response time requirement
- Monitor memory usage with larger state space
